Deployment of this software at http://fdrs.forest.go.th

Summary: screen, caddy, cron.
NB: Since the script (app_test.py) runs under screen, it will NOT recover automatically if the
host is re-started.

The software is a direct clone of this Github repository, running under the screen software,
unprivileged user's account, as follows:

while (true)
do
    python app.py --port=8080
    sleep 10
done

As the root user, the caddy software maps the port 8080 into the https port. Caddy runs
with the following configuration:

fdrs.forest.go.th {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}

Additionally, two cron jobs take care of
-downloading the most recent NC files (download_d03.py)
-restarting the server when a new NC file has been downloaded

These cron jobs are running under the same unprivileged account as the software.
